# Drag and drop usage in React
In this repo I'm trying to mimic the drag and drop behaviour which can be seen in a Trello board

## Directory structure
* /src - contains all the components

## File structure
* Paragraph.js - Draggable paragraph component
* Image.js - Draggable image component
* Link.js - Draggable link component
* Dropzone.js - Dropzone component
